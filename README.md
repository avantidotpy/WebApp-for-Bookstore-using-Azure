# WebApp-for-Bookstore-using-Azure

This project presents an online reselling bookstore website acting as a centralized database, cataloging a wide range of books by title, author, and cost. To ensure optimal performance and prevent site crashes, the system is hosted on Microsoft Azure. Leveraging PHP and MySQL as the backend and HTML/CSS as the frontend, users can browse books, view prices, search for specific titles, and make bookings seamlessly. The Azure-based cloud infrastructure ensures efficient monitoring of website traffic, performance optimization through analytics, and scalability for both internal and external applications within the cloud environment. It effectively handles a multitude of users, allowing registrations and book orders while maintaining an optimal website performance.

The Azure environment offers a secure ecosystem with access control (IAM) features, enabling role assignments to manage access to resources. This ensures agility within the system by allocating distinct user groups for various activities, enhancing the overall integrity and security of the website. Real-time threat analysis and proactive response to device activities further fortify the system against potential security threats, ensuring well-managed threat mitigation practices.
